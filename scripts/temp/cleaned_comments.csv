uDup7cYNU6c,Why are they focusing on FrameGen and Raytracing so much? The vast majority of games have horrible raytracing and most games that look great do NOT need raytracing because the artists are competent enough to design lighting properly.

uDup7cYNU6c,"It should be illegal for companies to market fake frames as performance uplift. The 5090 is only around 40% faster than 4090 with RT and without frame generation. Assuming 5000 series RT is stronger, that means the raw raster performance uplift is even lower. Judging by how 5090 has way more cores and way higher TDP, nVidia is literally just brute forcing its GPU for those gains with little to no efficiency improvements. Most of the new architectural designs are dedicated to improving AI performance, to bring you more fake frames.",9,2025-01-07T04:49:30Z

DLSS 4 + Frame Gen dependant -> literally meant that the ""real-time AI generated footage"" looked like I was trying to stream ""Forspoken"" through GeForce Now on a 33.6Kbps US Robotics Modem. So blurry in motion that it made motion blur completely pointless and obsolete!  5070 -> having 4090 performance for $550 is actually not bad at all, but since the above-mentioned points are facts, based on the declarations in this video, what does exactly the 5070 delivers? And how can it be measured, since all that was said and presented here is ""AI dependant""?  5090 -> ""TWICE the performance of the 4090"".... But... Why? It's 3x more capable than the 5070, for 4x the money and yet somehow only delivers 2x the performance? And ""It's also a good investment""? WHAT?! WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE 50 SERIES DELIVERS???  Jason dear, you failed Math, didn't you? 3x the numbers, 4x the price, 2x the performance (completely dependant on the new AI features), yeah... This doesn't add up. At all!  1 thing I agree with you though, ""AI came home to Nvidia"" and ""it's only possible because of AI"". Sure! Totally!  Also, BTW: the ""G force"" is called gravity!

The real issue then becomes do the upscaled resolution generated frames look good enough compared to straight rasterized frames scenes as a trade-off, including any issues related to movement, even when operating in 4k?

Doing some rounding, the 35 ms latency of the 5090 gives 1/0.035 ~= 29 natural frames, where the 4090 37 ms gives 1/0.037 ~= 27 natural frames. This seems pretty in line with the original raw natural framerate numbers we've seen in Nvidia's own material from the 5090 and 4090 videos using no AI frame generation. Basically, no matter how many AI frames you cram in, the latency will still feel like 27fps without the natural frames to work with.

One of the odd things I learned was that anyone who had a 4080 or a 4080 Super could get similar nodes per second search versus a 4090. There was very little difference in performance and I'm not sure why that would be the case since the 4090 had way more cuda cores than a 4080 or 4080 Super.

And of course you are getting drivers update behind a series. NVIDIA is forcing you to pay for 90 class so much, they are willing to make the 5080 absolutely useless. At that point you can get 5070ti with close to same cuda cores, same vram and overall the performance will be close to the same.

3a8dScJg6O0,"I just want to put this in to try and explain DLSS and frame gen to people who don't fully understand.              ""DLSS uses AI algorithms to upscale lower-resolution images, significantly enhancing visual fidelity while maintaining high performance. By rendering games at a lower resolution and then upscaling them, DLSS can significantly increase frame rates. This is especially beneficial for demanding games, allowing for smoother gameplay on high settings. DLSS can adapt its quality settings based on the performance of the hardware, ensuring an optimal balance between visual fidelity and frame rates. While DLSS generally provides high-quality images, it can sometimes introduce artifacts, such as blurriness or ghosting, especially in fast-moving scenes. DLSS operates in real-time, allowing it to provide upscaled images while the game is being played. This is crucial for maintaining a smooth gaming experience. DLSS does not introduce significant input latency. While any processing can potentially add a slight delay, NVIDIA has optimized DLSS to minimize this impact, ensuring that it remains responsive during gameplay.""              So this being said, every frame from the game is being rastered by the GPU in a lower resolution and then in real time it is being upscaled by the GPU to you're monitors resolution, depending on the DLSS quality setting you pick, the native resolution is a different percentage of the native resolution. This means that DLSS is not the problem with so called ""fake frames"" DLSS is actually a really good system that NVIDIA has created.                Frame gen is the Fake frames that get hated on but, that being said Frame Gen has its place in gaming. If you want to play a single player or even multiplayer game that does not rely on fast precise inputs or you're the type of person who is not sensitive to latency it can be a great thing. I personally use DLSS on most games as I have a 4080 and a 5120x1440p super ultrawide monitor, that is a lot of native pixels to push on very high settings.                 I have only used frame gen on Flight Simulator as the title is very demanding and doesn't require me to worry about input latency, and in that use case it is very nice in my eyes.

So sure I love the tech, but for PC enthusiasts, this means more latency, blurrier games, less need for optimisation so it will be a lost artnas explained by 'Threat Interactive' and just more and more reliance on fancy tech rather than actually improvements.  It is strange to me how all of you hype this up when not too many years ago it was seen as a scam and I'm just confused. What am I talking about? Well remember how back in the day it was a HUGE deal that ASUS released a NATIVE 240Hz monitor? The first of its kind and not like the other brands that had to (at the time) FAKE it by generating frames in between to make it look like 165Hz etc? I know the tech has gotten better, but it's funny to me how gamers used to celebrate native performance and look down on fake generation and demanded better, now we're celebrating that very thing.  Turn off all the AI tech and compare the cards that way and let yourself realise you're paying multiple month salaries for that miniscule improvement, you aren't paying for the card, you're paying for the AI at this point, an AI to fool you into thinking the card is more powerful than it is. Again it LOOKS cool and might even FEEL cool just walking around and chill gaming, but how responsive and smooth is it really during extreme high intensity stuff most of you will do? Or are you really planning on buying this card for walking around in gaming? Even as a single player old chill man at this point I have to question this.  If you prefer it, cool, genuinely, that's yoyr opinion and it's awesome, I just cannot justify the pricing and the idea of quite literally paying to be fooled that you have a strong PC by an AI, it's werid to me.",0,2025-01-12T14:03:48Z

3a8dScJg6O0,"4:37 Playing Cyberpunk with the new frame generation feature essentially feels like a DLSS 4 demo. It doesn't provide a clear comparison to the performance of the RTX 4090. With PCL values of 35 and 37, the estimated framerate is around 30 FPS at 1080p with DLSS Performance mode. While you might see ""263"" or ""125"" FPS, the latency is comparable to running at 30 FPS. Ideally, 263 FPS should result in approximately 3.8 milliseconds of latency, and 125 FPS should yield around 8 milliseconds. However, the actual latency is 5-10 times higher than if the game were running natively at those framerates. This makes playing any FPS game with such latency quite challenging, especially with a mouse and keyboard.  Don't be fooled‚ÄîNVIDIA is using DLSS 4 to mask the actual performance of the cards. Frame generation is cool tech and has decent use if the base framerate is at least 60 and is used on slower-paced games, likely with a controller. However, NVIDIA is advertising an actual performance jump of at most 30-45% as a doubling, without taking into account the input latency cost of frame generation. You can see on NVIDIA's 5090 page that, assuming the settings are comparable, the 5090 was getting around 27 FPS without DLSS or frame generation enabled at native 4K, with the 4090 getting around 22 FPS.",0,2025-01-13T02:31:32Z

3a8dScJg6O0,"This trend of treating consumers as quasi-beta testers is deeply frustrating, especially when companies have the resources and historical examples of doing it right. The 'win-win' for them‚Äîreduced development costs and the ability to fix issues on the fly‚Äîoften becomes a lose-lose for players who endure incomplete launches, constant updates, and the risk of games becoming unplayable due to server dependency.  Take Halo as a perfect example. Bungie, under Microsoft‚Äôs umbrella, delivered a polished and optimized game across multiple systems back in 2003, even without today‚Äôs advanced tools or infrastructure. This shows that the current issues aren‚Äôt about technical limitations‚Äîthey‚Äôre about misplaced priorities and business strategies.  What‚Äôs even worse is the push toward online content for single-player experiences. Multiplayer dependency is understandable, but locking single-player titles behind servers feels exploitative. The nostalgia for self-contained, well-tested games like Halo or older Call of Duty titles is bittersweet‚Äîthose games didn‚Äôt just work; they excelled.  To add insult to injury, this trend even impacts hardware adoption. The pressure to upgrade just to 'keep up' with poorly optimized software is absurd. Hardware diversity and innovation used to be exciting, but now, it feels overshadowed by teams who prioritize marketing tactics over user experience. It‚Äôs bad not just for consumers, but also for reviewers. I miss the days when hardware and software came together to truly elevate gaming.",0,2025-01-15T15:23:24Z

3a8dScJg6O0,"To all the people raging since DLSS was announced, about loss of quality (blurry image), fake details, fake frames, etc. you were never forced to buy any nvidia product, you were never forced to use any of these features, RT drops your fps? you don't enjoy it? well don't use it! stop complaining... Today nvidia seems to be the leader in gaming technologies, AMD and Intel always come after with a copy (FSR, XeSS), don't take me wrong, that's a good thing, just to say, if everything they do sucks, why do other companies do the same ?  I've read some that says the RTX 5090 runs Cyberpunk 2077 barely at 30 fps with maximum settings and without DLSS... do you even know that having raytracing in realtime is magic ? Usually and depending of the scene complexity and display definition, raytracing and moreover pathtracing can take several seconds/minutes/hours for A SINGLE image in 3D softwares like Blender/Maya/3DSMax... but Nvidia managed to bring this techno that exists since decades to us, gamers, for those who want to experiment it with some drawbacks obviously.  I am still on a 2080 SUPER, playing games on high @1440p with RT+DLSS enabled when it's fluid enough (80-90 fps) and I'll certainly buy a 5070 Ti in the future because it will be enough for the next 5-6 years.

It means your gameplay will be 75% AI powered and 25% real. So if a game runs at 60 FPS, using DLSS it will run at 240 FPS giving 180 FAKE FPS and surely increasing latency.

DLSS, even 4.0 still adds a lot or bluriness and dynamic scenes look like horror (around 17:00).

Q82tQJyJwgk,"Let me get this straight... So, Nvidia says we should want the 5090 because we get 25-30% more performance while consuming 36% more power, with a tiny chance at the the privilege to pay just 25% more than when compared to the 4090 launch?   It's been almost 2.5 years since the 4090 and in that time Nvidia essentially gives a bigger die with 33% more of the same 4090 GPU cores another 33% more slightly faster VRAM, basically 33% more 4090 for 25-30% more performance and more fake/inferred frames?   Nvidia didn't innovate or improve the GPU hardware one bit, every added capability or real generational improvement is the AI specific hardware, they took a bit more of their other Enterprise AI tech and bolted them on, switched to the latest Gen VRAM, jacked up the price and tells us we'll take what they give us and we'll like it.   Seriously, the comments about this being a 4090 Ti are really quite accurate. This is little more than a 4090 with some more cores and newer VRAM which Nvidia had little to do with outside of deciding to use it.   If this isn't proof that Nvidia is done with gaming GPUs then I don't know what else to tell you. Why waste time and resources on the consumer gaming GPU products when the same Blackwell silicon can be used in enterprise AI solutions and results in many times higher profit margins than when sold in products for gamers?",926,2025-01-24T00:58:52Z

However, this analysis has the caveat that it's rare for the 4090 to pull the entire available 450W (as evidenced by the fact that it only loses a mere 2% on average at 350W vs 450W), so it's not perfectly apples-to-apples.

General meshing/albedo should already be pretty damn fast no? Why not just generate 1/4 frames for the RT GI pass or something? Then you'd only have artifacts on the overlayed light which which would prob be hidden in with the RT denoising artifacts.  I think it'd be a lot less obvious to the naked eye as it would be less disruptive on the edges of solid objects/or could be excluded from POV animations as they tend to move faster (by being closer to the camera).

5YJNFREQHiw,"When Nvidia is chalking out a new product range, there is a maximum die size that they can produce cost effectively at scale. Assuming Moore's law is mostly trucking along, it's around 600mm2 and 40% faster than last gen. For this example, lets say a new generation die is 600mm2 and has 10,000 cores and is given the nomenclature EX-102 (102 notates that highest end non data center silicon)  The tradition would then follow that their Titan and Quadro cards would get 95%-100% of the number of cores that this full 102 die has to offer (because they are using this die). So in this example they would have 10,000 cores.  The 80ti - Also on a 102 - 93% of the 10,000 cores, so around 9300 cores.  The 80 - 102/103 - 66-80% of the 102's full cores. But here's the thing. Sometimes these end up on 103. A smaller, cheaper, die. The other skus up until this point have fused off sections of the 102 die. The 103 is a different piece of silicon entirely. While it might seem unfair to compare them, they are still the same in architecture and scale linearly in some workloads. In any case, we would expect 66% of the cores or in this example 6600 cuda cores.  The 70 class cards are normally 50% and built on 104 so 5000 cores  The 60 class on 106 and hovers around the low 30s or 3000 cores  -----------------------------------------------  This is the expectation as it has been set for the better part of 15 years. It has only been until last gen [4000 series] that we received cards that were substantially different.  The last 90 sku was 87% of the full 102 die. Substantially less than a normal 80ti or titan but curiously, significantly more money. The 80ti, which used to give you the most silicon for the money (again around 90%) is now gone and replaced with the 4080 super, which was 55%. A noticeable drop in the amount of silicon. The standard 4080 even worse at 52%. The 4070 is a shocking 32%.  Using the data I've listed above, it is clear to see that Nvidia has merely moved their entire stack down to make room for their 90 class cards. Again... these 90 cards have no substantial architecture differences that justifies the creation of a new sku. They aren't substantially more silicon. No",0,2025-01-24T09:06:12Z

Q82tQJyJwgk,"Frame generation always creates artifacts in my experience. In fast movement, you can always see it and it really is noticable. Only in reeeealy slow movements it‚Äôs ok. But what game do you know that only has slow movement? It would be a pretty boring game. Don‚Äôt know if MFG makes artifacts worse or better but for me FG is kinda not worth it. If you have 80+ frames, you don‚Äôt want 100 frames but full of artifacts. If you have 45 frames, it will stutter sometimes and will have even more artifacts just to get to 60.

5YJNFREQHiw,"8:36 i wouldnt say that. AMD obviosly proved themselves with the 7900XTX. sure, they did say they arent competing in the high end market anymore. but you never know. They could pull a fast one. They beat Intel after all. If they decide to make a high end card this time around that could sit between the 4090 and 5090 with less power draw and less price, (eg. RX 9090XTX) that, in my eyes, would be better than the 5090 based off of price and power draw alone as long as it sat between the 4090 and 5090 in terms of performance. And also, Obviosly they cant match it right now because THEY HAVENT RELEASED THE 9000 SERIES YET. WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT THE 9060 AND 9070 SERIES. One of AMD's strengths is creating efficient processors. so I think they'd be more than capable to make a GPU around 50% better than the 7900XTX. Which would place it between the 4090 and 5090. and I guarantee you if they did it. it would be far more efficient.",5,2025-01-24T15:49:04Z

Q82tQJyJwgk,"6:50 Professional ""AI Dork"" here... The 5090 having 32GB VRAM is basically useless. It will not be able to run hardly anything that the 4090 can't already run blisteringly fast  For example, my 3090 can generate text with a maximum size model that can fit in 24GB VRAM at over 120 words per second across 4 streams, which is already monumentally faster than any normal person can read  Now, the 5090 can fit damn near no bigger models (cause 32GB VRAM is still pitifully small for LLMs, not even being able to fit a full precision 20B param model when we have models that are 600B-1T+ in size now), but at an even faster speed, which basically nobody wants. The limit of quality for local AI is not speed. It hasn't been for a very long time. The limit is quality and network size, something of which the 5090 will do basically nothing to improve.  So in essence, you can't really run anything too much better on the 5090, and now instead of generating at 3x the speed you can read, you can gen at 4x the speed you can read... groundbreaking  So yeah, the 32GB VRAM for the 5090 is the absolute bare minimum they could have given, and will still be a severe artificial limit on how useful the 5090 will ever be. A 3 gen old original A6000, which is like 1/5th the speed of the 5090 is far more useful, simply for the fact it has 48GB VRAM. People want better quality, not more speed when you are already way faster than you need to be",1,2025-01-24T20:53:53Z

It should be shocking that a game from 5 years ago needs a +1500$ GPU to run above 60 FPS at 1440p, on Ultra yes, but the tech's been around for so long.  A 9800 GT, a mid-range GPU from 2008 costing 160$ can run Far Cry 1 at 1080p, max settings and above 120 FPS, a game that's 4 years older than it.

Q82tQJyJwgk,"The 50 series is a huge letdown. They're good cards of course, but the way Nvidia talks about this stuff, you always expect a revolution, and you get an evolution. These are 40 series cards with a crapload of power pumped into them to keep stable. This is not exactly ideal. Nvidia is way too distracted with side projects. They've got 5000 features they're working on, and only a small handful of them ever pan out. Don't get me wrong, I love Nvidia. If it weren't for them, we'd be in a world of hurt. However, when it comes to just raw 3d rendering, we're getting screwed. I bought a GTX1080 for $500 in 2017, and today that will buy me a 4070. The 4070S is another $120. 8 years and only 85% improvement. That's insane. There was almost the same improvement from the 900 series to the 10 series, and that was 2 years. People always ask me ""dude how can you still run a GTX1080 and a 7700k?!?!"" and it's because I have a Gsync 144hz display, and in competitive games we all turn down graphics settings so I get lots of frames, and in games that aren't competitive, I have Gsync. So really nothing will change yet. Not until I can afford a card that will drive 1440p at 240hz+ for affordable prices. I'm not paying a thousand dollars for a graphics card.

My 8gb of my 2080 super are becoming inadequate, so it feels like, if I'm gonna spend $1,000 on a 4090, I might as well jump to $2,000 for the latest, just based on that vram.  But I buy GPUs at the top end so I don't have to buy them for a while.  And I do like to max out the settings.

Q82tQJyJwgk,"One way to explain the tensor cores and neural shading is as follows: The neural networks can be used to approximate extremely complicated functions for which we can't just write simple equations. However, we can create those networks with a simple procedure merely by showing them many examples. So for example we can show it what rocky terrain looks like at all levels of detail, and the network will learn how to do that, using less data (just what the network's values are) than trying to store all the terrain (what the network computes as output). It's sort of like procedural terrain, but learned instead of programmed. The tensor cores are what are used to efficiently compute those trained neural networks on the GPU. They're not the same as geometry or pixel shaders, so they need their own specialized cores for the task.",0,2025-01-25T16:24:30Z

Q82tQJyJwgk,"I think the simplest way to explain convolutional neural networks is: for every pixel, a new pixel value is calculated based on its nearby neighbours. E.g. if every pixel is replaced with the average of its neighbours, you get a blur effect. Think of a visual illusion where you see some broken lines and your mind fills in the missing parts of the line, that's how these CNNs would be used to preserve detail as they upscale. However, it's a lot of computation, and a challenge to preserve scene integrity because the neighbourhoods are small compared to the entire scene. Transformer models allow arbitrary areas to serve as context when computing new pixel values; think of it as like having configurable neighbourhoods to input to that computation. E.g. when trying to upscale the left side of a road in the game's scene, that computation can also refer to the right side of the road all the way across the screen.",0,2025-01-25T16:59:05Z

Nvidia completely forgot about the people that put them on the map.

They will limit production, the prices will get inflated even more, and just doodoo on the on the gamers.  They have a different line of products for production, while good to have the flexibility, it only limits the stock further.  While a 30% markup can be sustained for income (as you mentioned). This is hardly for your viewer base.  Exciting tech, yes.  I guess you don't really remember what it was like to have a limited source of income.  Like when you get a GPU to review and keep (or even sell in some cases).

Now imagine 4K. We just started getting into that resolution. My 144Hz monitor supports 165Hz OC via DSC, but I have it at comfortable 100Hz which I love.   Plus, capped frame rates and the GPU not only stays in cool levels, but the capping also helps in smoother gameplay since the GPU can be better in synchronization with the CPU. You can look it up, here, on YT. Capping the frame rates is good, end of story. Power consumption way less and the sync with the GPU culminates in smooth response times.

But when you  compare apples to apples with the 40 series vs 30 series against the 50 series in less than the 90 flagship. the bus size matters. Nobody wants that AI generated frames they call DLSS that decreases resolution. Give us true specs and not that AI hack that gives us blurred resolution. 30 series the memory bus was good. Starting with 40 series Nividia skimped out and scammed everyone with a shit resolution hack. DLSS, truly its a hack, not even an AI hack but a lower resolution hack. Apples to Apples, or its no dice, unless you like 720 p. Analog is better than 720. For 50 series cards less than the 5090, the 30 series cards hang with the 50 series for true FPS. Im talking 3080 vs 5080. Especially in higher resolution, and screw that ray tracing.  For the money, it is not worth it at all. AMD for true FPS and resolution unless youre a pro gamer that is ok with 1080p and its for competition. For the average player, AMD wins.

What i feel nvidia is trying to do is cut down the cost for their gpu components and put the hard work all on ai. So basically their gpu's in the near 6 years won't be doing much hard work but their Ai technology will which users like us wont be able to notice. Through this move they would cut down production cost for all of their gpus and can stay consistent with the gpu pricing like $2000 for the next 10 generation but still make 5x more profit which they are making right now without Ai.    So in simple words slowly all the hardware we use will merely become a empty containers which takes all the energy through Ai and dont have anything inside them.",0,2025-01-26T14:42:09Z

Q82tQJyJwgk,This was pretty much my conclusion too. The 5090 is just a 4090-Super-Duper and the only impressive thing about it is the fact they fit this MEGALODON GPU into a 2-slot card with no issues. The 5080 looks decent but 16GB is a bit low considering its supposed to be 20% faster than 4080-Super. The 5070-Ti is the card that makes sense to me this generation. Should be the same performance as 4080-Super for $250 less. Thats just a win in my book. And then the 5070 12GB just doesn't have enough VRAM again so if you are looking for a card around $500 Ill probably refer you to AMDs 9070/XT.,0,2025-01-26T16:38:14Z

Hopefully this is just a card that has benefited from Nvidias AI-research because i think that is where most of their R&D are right now (because honestly, you wouldn't gain that much from upgrading from a 4090 to anything as a gamer anyway because it still crushes everything unless you play cyberpunk), and they just spitted out the 5000 series because they had to in a marketing sense, even if the ""real"" performance gains isn't that much.  But still, too early to call it yet, should give it a couple of months after it is launched for people to poke and prod it and give Nvidia time to update some drivers, maybe the ""real"" performance gains compared to the 4090 goes from 30% closer to 40% so it matches the power requirement better.",0,2025-01-26T22:51:25Z

The right one a blurry mess - f.e. the wrinkles on the forehead and, by God, just look at these eyes! Now pause at 7:38 and look at the face gear (left strap, or whatever it is) or that square cutout below.

Max Ultra settings vs lowest settings and lower resolution creates a drastically lower input delay and increased responsiveness. Thats the distinction. You will always be able to ""feel"" the increased delay whether it can be seen or not.  What this means is until they are able to increase responsiveness alongside the fake frames it does absolutely nothing for your performance from an input delay perspective. You might as well tape a post it note with 10,000 fps on it because if you don't have this 5090 which will never just be ""only 2,000"" dollars you are gonna be playing with the input delay of 20-60 fps while it ""looks"" like 200+.

Sometimes, Linus isn‚Äôt the best messenger for some messages and when it comes to GPUs ( a sector once discussed on WAN show to turn more in to written format than remain on video) you really do need everyone on board fairly and genuinely represent the myriad use cases and consideration for such a piece of technology.  What keeps it fresh is that the various speakers bring THEIR expertise, and THEIR passion for that thing they do, in the name of enabling more informed purchases to be made in cool things.  Whilst passion comes in spades with Linus, the expertise‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt, at least not always and so some of that passion can ring hollow as a result. He talks outside of school a lot sometimes and that‚Äôs not good for anyone.

Q82tQJyJwgk,"sorry guys, (and other youtube commenters)  i watched the entire video and I still don't know if I should upgrade or wait on my 2060 build from 2019.... any chance you could do a guide for the average schmo like me?? I've got as much as ¬£2500 to spend on a new PC if I push myself and save up (and keep the heating off this winter like i have been!) So, should I go for a 4070 custom from Cyberpower (or other custom pc provider) or wait until the next generation. I will also say that (almost) all of the games I am interested in playing work on my 1440p monitor to a satisfactory degree on the 2060 with a i5-9600k cpu play decently - although I have to sacrifice some graphical fidelity or FPS. Its been a few years, so I am ready to spend more money than i spent on my current system to updrade, but I'm wondering how long I should wait. if it helps to diagnose my needs, the games I am struggling to play are Cyberpunk (60fps on med with DLSS), KCD (45fps~) and starfield (50fps~ on med). I'm good with skipping Starfield as it is unplayable at any FPS (holy shit, Bethesda need to update their gameplay) but I quite liked KCD and Cyberpunk - although the low fps made me decide to come back to them with a better system. I also have a lot of newer games in mind to play, which I am certain the 2060 will struggle with, but am willing to play indie titles or older games for the next coupe of years if it means I can skip a few generations of poor value from Nvidia. I have never owned a Radion Card... but also, maybe unfairly, aren't interested in them either - I think (possibly incorrectly) that Nvidia is better value in the long term (as I can only afford to upgrade every 5-6 years)... so what do you reckon I should do guys??",2,2025-01-29T21:19:57Z

Fbg7ChsjmEA,"Hey, just some feedback regarding the graphs.  I think it would be nice to have a better indicator to more easily differentiate the specific card which is being reviewed, especially since this is arguably the most important part of these graphs, where the card being reviewed sits in relation to the other cards on the market. The green dot is nice, but it could still be more clear (having it be a different colour, more saturated, white border/background, etc), especially when there are multiple different cards highlighted in this way. (This goes along with the feedback which I'm sure you have seen in the other comment/s, about having the whole row highlighted to more easily see which specific card you are drawing attention to, rather than having to pan across from the dot on the right to the name on the left).  Also, I feel like having the 1% lows for every card in the fps graphs creates more clutter than it adds value to the graphs (at least for me), as in almost every case the 1% lows are roughly the same percentage lower for every card. I found myself essentially ignoring them completely, and instead mainly just looking at the overall length of the bar, which ended up just being the average because it is longer. Personally, I the main thing I gained from the 1% lows bar is the difference between the average frame rates and 1% lows for each individual card, which is good for the card being reviewed, but isn't very useful for the 3090 when the review is focused on the 5080. If there is a particular case in which the 1% lows show a significantly different story to the averages, I think it would be better to instead mention this specifically, alongside a graph displaying primarily (or only) the 1% lows. Maybe an option would by to only show 1% lows for the card in the review, which would both help differentiate the card being reviewed from the rest of the cards, remove clutter, and, in my opinion, retain the most valuable bit of information that 1% lows show (how they compare to the fps average of the card being reviewed).  Last thing, it would be nice to have some way to more easily differentiate the different generations of card. The most frequent questions I find myself asking are ""how does this compare to the nvidia cards from the last generation"", ""how does this compare the other nvidia cards of this generation"" and ""how does this compare to amd"". All of these would be much easier to answer if the generations were grouped in some",0,2025-01-30T07:34:02Z

This is the point where many people, companies and businesses will work smarter to save a lot of time, but you will see the quality decrease in certain areas. The effort needs to still be higher than what they put in and it is clear that they are heavily invested in AI as they should, but so is their reliance on it being their saving grace. I purchased a laptop with a 4070 two years ago at a crazy price and I saw the great improvements, but if I had not got such a good deal then I wouldn't have bothered. The graphics and DLSS is great, but I still see that it is not what it used to be, but to be fair completely to Nvidia as well, this also comes down to the game development corporations, which do the exact same thing. I cannot say it's the developers but down to budgets and times that go into their corporate leadership. Old games that had insane graphics back then, should have taken our developments to new heights, but no of course. Maximize profits and screw the quality. Same old, let's pray that Nvidia manages to rectify themselves and give us hope. The balance will come in one shape or another. You can only fool people for so long.",0,2025-01-30T10:20:31Z

I truly hope nVidia isn't s******g the bed with their goals here, cause we need continuous competition in the market.  But as it stands *right now*, this generation looks like crap.",0,2025-01-31T07:17:35Z

Not to mention the powe bill of having a 24/7 heater on that will require extra AC in the summer (it will absolutely be impactful on your home HVAC solution).  Everything about the 5090 is just... impressive, but lazy... and kind of shit.  GPUs are becoming like phones: buying the flagship has absolutely no benefit to the average user, so buying an older gen for cheaper, or a lower tier model and sitting on it for 5 years is by far the best choice.

In reality, there are two unstoppable barriers stopping rasterization improvements, which is the real reason for slowing down of performance of non AI features. This is why AMD is so far behind Nvidia, and actually, thanks to the AI boom, 50xx series of cards has better raster improvements than the gaming market could fund by themselves. The limits of bandwidth and memory cell size just limit what can be coherent on a chip, as while transistor sizes has gone down over last 10 years, bandwidth and memory cell size has stayed the same.

What's crazy is there are people running the 1080's still without issues on a lot of games and that thing has been out for like a decade or more, and I just don't see these modern cards being able to keep up for nearly as long. I'm disappointed in the advancement of gaming hardware recently (or lack thereof) seems like there used to be a significant difference between generations and now it's like ""here's another $1,000+ GPU that's 10-15% better than the last $1,000+ GPU you bought a year ago"".

5YJNFREQHiw,"No, it does not break the laws of physics. A 600W GPU can produce less heat than a 400W GPU if it is more efficient in converting electrical power into useful work (such as rendering frames) rather than waste heat.  How Is This Possible?  Higher Efficiency Components  Newer GPUs use advanced silicon fabrication processes (e.g., smaller nanometer nodes like 3nm or 5nm).  These processes improve power efficiency, meaning more energy is used for computation rather than heat dissipation.  Better Power Delivery & VRMs  Higher-quality voltage regulation modules (VRMs) and power management techniques reduce wasted energy in conversion.  Advanced Cooling Solutions  Vapor chamber cooling, better heatsinks, and fans can dissipate heat more effectively.  This means even if total power consumption is higher, the GPU surface feels cooler due to better heat dissipation.  Dynamic Power Management  Modern GPUs optimize power usage dynamically, consuming only what is needed per workload, reducing unnecessary heat generation.  Example:  A 400W GPU with 75% efficiency wastes 100W as heat (400W √ó 25%).  A 600W GPU with 90% efficiency wastes 60W as heat (600W √ó 10%).  Even though the 600W GPU draws more power, it generates less heat overall because it converts more of that power into useful work rather than waste heat.",1,2025-01-31T23:33:39Z

Fbg7ChsjmEA,"I feel like this is because games aren't requiring faster data speeds..... they're requiring more data at once, per transfer. Software is outpacing elements of hardware in relation to the system as a whole. Look at the one spec that sets the 4090/5090/7900XTX apart from the rest.... Bus size. I feel like we've reached the limit for a single frame of what can be rasterized on camera given the current state of AAA optimization standards with the addition of ray tracing data.   Were going to be forced to accept AI eventually or someone is going to have to figure out a way to greatly widen the 'freeways' on our mother boards. It almost feels like Nvidia has contracts with developers to collude.   AMD needs to find a way to make their own mother boards with built in memory. If they can make a special CPU that can communicate with a far greater bus width in one of their GPU's.. I have a feeling it would solve the problem of low frame rates with Ray Tracing. Our bus sizes are just enough for 4k, add in Ray Tracing data and now for the complete frame, the data needs two trips for one frame. All DLSS is doing is freeing up bus space by lowering the resolution so the ray tracing data can fit across the bus at the same time as everything else and finish the frame in one trip. AMD doesn't need AI or DLSS, they can control both ends of the stick CPU - GPU. Nvidia can't. and I feel like Nvidia knows this, hence why they are locking down developers like Sony does to promote AI.. It allows Nvidia to increase frames, without destroying compatibility  raising bus speeds.. you would need proper CPU's, motherboards & memory (and probably more stuff I don't know) to do so. I think this is also why their doing this crap with TAA. It's all a solution to work around forcing people to upgrade their entire PC's with special motherboards/memory/cpu.  If the bus width is the amount of data at once (single signal) the lanes from your GPU to CPU can transfer..... I look at it like pipes with water... eventually you won't be able to increase the flow rate with pressure alone,  you would need to widen the pipes. When a single frame now requires both image rasterization data (that's now unoptimized) AND ray tracing data, you run out of room. If data is water you've now got a higher flow rate",0,2025-02-01T00:40:10Z

xVEtLb8Wx5M,"It's actually worth mentioning that some of the 'weirdness on the edges of fast moving objects' that you see and show seems to be motion blur artifacts, not DLSS artifacts. The way motion blur and lens blur works in games is, as everything, very faked, it usually is only supplied with information that can be gathered from 1 single frame - depth maps and pixel velocity maps. And since it does not know what's behind the object that needs to be blurred, plus some other issues like overlaying and opacity, it often results in weird artifacts at the edges of blurred objects.  So to make a fair test it should be made between True frames rendered without DLSS and with DLSS, with all other settings equal.

xVEtLb8Wx5M,Thank you for a nuanced approach to all this new tech. Most haters get it wrong because they don't understand how much more calculations a game like Cyberpunk does compared to an older game like Battefield 4 for example. The difference is like 100x per pixel more for Cyberpunk. If you want to play it at high resolution then AI tricks are the only options for now. We are also at a point where graphics chips are getting ridiculously expensive to manufacture because of their size and number of cores. Just a quick note. The 4000 series supports the new DLSS4 with the transformer model also. Just not the multi frame generation. you can do 2X but not 3X or 4X which is locked to the 5000 series.,0,2025-02-06T00:33:54Z

I am suprised that the 980 was able to start that benchmark at all. I believe what is happening is that the textures in the gpu memory are constantly being rotated in and out of vram, using up all the bandwidth between the CPU and the GPU, explaining the very poor performance. You should be getting around ~150% more performance out of the 2080ti compared to the 980. Not 20 times.

5YJNFREQHiw,"Haven't really finished the video. The problem with the 5090 is that most of the frames will be generated by AI. It is good, right? Well, in single-player games that revolve around YOUR hardware and YOUR software, it is a massive spike in performance for most games when you talk about smoothness of the game. Now, for any MP game that relies on constant data from your computer and is reliant mostly on the server getting the data and sending you the data, it doesn't affect anything. If your software, on your PC generates additional 3 frames between the in-game frames, the server just DOESNT CARE. It will still utilize only the frames between the ones you generated. It doesn't care, it won't use and your visual smoothness is exactly that, - visual smoothness. They haven't actually increased performance, they added fake frames between the real frames, which doesn't equal performance in any way. And it is useful only in SP games that do not rely on client-server interaction. The servers won't use your fake frames and they don't care.",0,2025-02-07T13:55:39Z

AND is not able to even detect if any of the wires are broken.   600 watts through a single wire will cause a fire.  there are a couple vids with a low amount of views out there that explain and demonstrate this.  one shows that even on a non broken cable.  it's possible for one wire to be handeling 22 amps while the others are only doing 3-6 amps.   you can garantee that nvidia is going to have to do a recall on these cards.,1,2025-02-12T12:00:58Z

Q82tQJyJwgk,Cyberpunk is more than 4 years old and we still don't have a card that can do 60fps with all settings maxed including path tracing at 4k native. Maybe around 2026 we'll get it. See you then.,0,2025-02-20T07:05:24Z
Q82tQJyJwgk,Since this video was created there has been so much testing and shown the product is not as good as Nvidia you mention. As you are gaining money from this review by gaining money through advertising. You are therefore liable to claims of false advertising.,0,2025-02-20T07:39:20Z

Q82tQJyJwgk,@LinusTechTips please tell me why the F is nvidia screwing with the consumer and not producing the 5000 series gpu's so that everyone would be able to buy it... i just got ripped off by a scammer as i was trying to buy a 4090 in resell market.. im so angry and sad on this situation.,0,2025-02-22T01:42:26Z

Fbg7ChsjmEA,"I've had a 1080 ti for about 7 / 8 years.... i hate the how expensive the market has gotten... I'm trying to buy a 5080 right now. But only because I talked myself down from a 5090 (i cant see myself spending 1k to get an extra 30 frames on max settings when I already know I'm turning them down to some extent anyway). But when the second hand market of 4080's and 4090's is still hovering at about a grand or two above msrp, the options of having a high vram card seems so unrealistic now. My 1080 put in a good run. but its died once, i had to revive it by redoing the thermal paste and heat pads already. But now it wines so much at even easy to run games. I wish they didn't just release 250 and 2500 total(ish) cards to a market when that's such a small fraction of the overall demand.",0,2025-02-22T03:03:04Z

vK2N9q9A54w,"I can't take any of these people seriously. The one is upset she never bought NVDA so is just praying it goes down. The other is talking about technicals and if it doesn't hold 125, it'll go down to 100. The issue today had nothing to do with NVDA. It was an overreaction to macro economic data that was ridiculous and the entire market went down. NVDA was at 141 before the biased Michigan survey came out. NVDA is cheap right now wrt P/E and I expect new all time highs by Thursday.",16,2025-02-22T04:38:53Z
