20,Q82tQJyJwgk,"Let me get this straight... So, Nvidia says we should want the 5090 because we get 25-30% more performance while consuming 36% more power, with a tiny chance at the the privilege to pay just 25% more than when compared to the 4090 launch? <br><br>It&#39;s been almost 2.5 years since the 4090 and in that time Nvidia essentially gives a bigger die with 33% more of the same 4090 GPU cores another 33% more slightly faster VRAM, basically 33% more 4090 for 25-30% more performance and more fake/inferred frames? <br><br>Nvidia didn&#39;t innovate or improve the GPU hardware one bit, every added capability or real generational improvement is the AI specific hardware, they took a bit more of their other Enterprise AI tech and bolted them on, switched to the latest Gen VRAM, jacked up the price and tells us we&#39;ll take what they give us and we&#39;ll like it. <br><br>Seriously, the comments about this being a 4090 Ti are really quite accurate. This is little more than a 4090 with some more cores and newer VRAM which Nvidia had little to do with outside of deciding to use it. <br><br>If this isn&#39;t proof that Nvidia is done with gaming GPUs then I don&#39;t know what else to tell you. Why waste time and resources on the consumer gaming GPU products when the same Blackwell silicon can be used in enterprise AI solutions and results in many times higher profit margins than when sold in products for gamers?",926,2025-01-24T00:58:52Z
21,Q82tQJyJwgk,"You know, something that almost everyone is ignoring... The thing just has 33% more Shaders... That means it&#39;s 0% faster, just more shaders.

These are 40 series cards with a crapload of power pumped into them to keep stable. This is not exactly ideal. Nvidia is way too distracted with side projects. They&#39;ve got 5000 features they&#39;re working on, and only a small handful of them ever pan out. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Nvidia. If it weren&#39;t for them, we&#39;d be in a world of hurt. However, when it comes to just raw 3d rendering, we&#39;re getting screwed. I bought a GTX1080 for $500 in 2017, and today that will buy me a 4070. The 4070S is another $120. 8 years and only 85% improvement. That&#39;s insane. There was almost the same improvement from the 900 series to the 10 series, and that was 2 years. People always ask me &quot;dude how can you still run a GTX1080 and a 7700k?!?!&quot; and it&#39;s because I have a Gsync 144hz display, and in competitive games we all turn down graphics settings so I get lots of frames, and in games that aren&#39;t competitive, I have Gsync. So really nothing will change yet. Not until I can afford a card that will drive 1440p at 240hz+ for affordable prices. I&#39;m not paying a thousand dollars for a graphics card.

It will not be able to run hardly anything that the 4090 can&#39;t already run blisteringly fast<br><br>For example, my 3090 can generate text with a maximum size model that can fit in 24GB VRAM at over 120 words per second across 4 streams, which is already monumentally faster than any normal person can read<br><br>Now, the 5090 can fit damn near no bigger models (cause 32GB VRAM is still pitifully small for LLMs, not even being able to fit a full precision 20B param model when we have models that are 600B-1T+ in size now), but at an even faster speed, which basically nobody wants. The limit of quality for local AI is not speed. It hasn&#39;t been for a very long time.

188,Q82tQJyJwgk,"&quot;The 5090 is overkill when you play in 1440p&quot; -I fully get it and partially agree, but in many games, it cannot get even the 144Hz of the current monitors, let alone 165Hz/240Hz (in full preset without RT). Now imagine 4K. We just started getting into that resolution. My 144Hz monitor supports 165Hz OC via DSC, but I have it at comfortable 100Hz which I love. <br><br>Plus, capped frame rates and the GPU not only stays in cool levels, but the capping also helps in smoother gameplay since the GPU can be better in synchronization with the CPU. You can look it up, here, on YT. Capping the frame rates is good, end of story. Power consumption way less and the sync with the GPU culminates in smooth response times.

219,Q82tQJyJwgk,"I think the simplest way to explain convolutional neural networks is: for every pixel, a new pixel value is calculated based on its nearby neighbours. E.g. if every pixel is replaced with the average of its neighbours, you get a blur effect. Think of a visual illusion where you see some broken lines and your mind fills in the missing parts of the line, that&#39;s how these CNNs would be used to preserve detail as they upscale. However, it&#39;s a lot of computation, and a challenge to preserve scene integrity because the neighbourhoods are small compared to the entire scene. Transformer models allow arbitrary areas to serve as context when computing new pixel values; think of it as like having configurable neighbourhoods to input to that computation. E.g. when trying to upscale the left side of a road in the game&#39;s scene, that computation can also refer to the right side of the road all the way across the screen.",0,2025-01-25T16:59:05Z

225,Q82tQJyJwgk,"One way to explain the tensor cores and neural shading is as follows: The neural networks can be used to approximate extremely complicated functions for which we can&#39;t just write simple equations. However, we can create those networks with a simple procedure merely by showing them many examples. So for example we can show it what rocky terrain looks like at all levels of detail, and the network will learn how to do that, using less data (just what the network&#39;s values are) than trying to store all the terrain (what the network computes as output). It&#39;s sort of like procedural terrain, but learned instead of programmed. The tensor cores are what are used to efficiently compute those trained neural networks on the GPU.

296,Q82tQJyJwgk,"sorry guys, (and other youtube commenters)  i watched the entire video and I still don&#39;t know if I should upgrade or wait on my 2060 build from 2019.... any chance you could do a guide for the average schmo like me?? I&#39;ve got as much as ¬£2500 to spend on a new PC if I push myself and save up (and keep the heating off this winter like i have been!) So, should I go for a 4070 custom from Cyberpower (or other custom pc provider) or wait until the next generation. I will also say that (almost) all of the games I am interested in playing work on my 1440p monitor to a satisfactory degree on the 2060 with a i5-9600k cpu play decently - although I have to sacrifice some graphical fidelity or FPS. Its been a few years, so I am ready to spend more money than i spent on my current system to updrade, but I&#39;m wondering how long I should wait. if it helps to diagnose my needs, the games I am struggling to play are Cyberpunk (60fps on med with DLSS), KCD (45fps~) and starfield (50fps~ on med). I&#39;m good with skipping Starfield as it is unplayable at any FPS (holy shit, Bethesda need to update their gameplay) but I quite liked KCD and Cyberpunk - although the low fps made me decide to come back to them with a better system. I also have a lot of newer games in mind to play, which I am certain the 2060 will struggle with, but am willing to play indie titles or older games for the next coupe of years if it means I can skip a few generations of poor value from Nvidia. I have never owned a Radion Card... but also, maybe unfairly, aren&#39;t interested in them either - I think (possibly incorrectly) that Nvidia is better value in the long term (as I can only afford to upgrade every 5-6 years)... so what do you reckon I should do guys??",2,2025-01-29T21:19:57Z

314,Q82tQJyJwgk,"Man, I can only hope one day Nvidia will make GPUs again.  Sure, the tech is cool, but I&#39;d rather see focus on a solid foundation of actual graphical processing, with neural shit being an additive that can be used to increase frames in exchange for some artifacts.  But it&#39;s treated as mandatory.  I&#39;d rather see something like a SOLID 120fps in those first graphs.  As much as that&#39;s overkill, and I&#39;m happy getting 60fps, or, depending on the game, even  30fps, I usually want to shoot for 120fps steady.  Especially in a game like Call of Duty.  And for $2,000, it just doesn&#39;t feel worth the money.  The ONE thing that is attractive is that 32gb of vram.  Devs seem to be getting more and more lazy with two things: Storage and vram.  My 8gb of my 2080 super are becoming inadequate, so it feels like, if I&#39;m gonna spend $1,000 on a 4090, I might as well jump to $2,000 for the latest, just based on that vram.  But I buy GPUs at the top end so I don&#39;t have to buy them for a while.  And I do like to max out the settings.  Honestly, I don&#39;t see the artifact in gameplay, but knowing they&#39;re there, and they could&#39;ve put more effort into proper raw performance bothers me greatly.",1,2025-01-25T14:02:40Z

They will limit production, the prices will get inflated even more, and just doodoo on the on the gamers.  They have a different line of products for production, while good to have the flexibility, it only limits the stock further.  While a 30% markup can be sustained for income (as you mentioned).

401,Q82tQJyJwgk,This was pretty much my conclusion too. The 5090 is just a 4090-Super-Duper and the only impressive thing about it is the fact they fit this MEGALODON GPU into a 2-slot card with no issues. The 5080 looks decent but 16GB is a bit low considering its supposed to be 20% faster than 4080-Super. The 5070-Ti is the card that makes sense to me this generation. Should be the same performance as 4080-Super for $250 less. Thats just a win in my book. And then the 5070 12GB just doesn&#39;t have enough VRAM again so if you are looking for a card around $500 Ill probably refer you to AMDs 9070/XT.,0,2025-01-26T16:38:14Z

Starting with 40 series Nividia skimped out and scammed everyone with a shit resolution hack. DLSS, truly its a hack, not even an AI hack but a lower resolution hack. Apples to Apples, or its no dice, unless you like 720 p. Analog is better than 720. For 50 series cards less than the 5090, the 30 series cards hang with the 50 series for true FPS. Im talking 3080 vs 5080. Especially in higher resolution, and screw that ray tracing.  For the money, it is not worth it at all.

1126,xVEtLb8Wx5M,The problem with dlss4 in the rtx5070 is that while in the 5090 on cyberpunk you are getting say 70fps without dlss4 on the 5070 that will be significantly less meaning the ai will have less frames to look at and ghosting and weird visual effects will be more apparent.

1250,xVEtLb8Wx5M,Thank you for a nuanced approach to all this new tech. Most haters get it wrong because they don&#39;t understand how much more calculations a game like Cyberpunk does compared to an older game like Battefield 4 for example. The difference is like 100x per pixel more for Cyberpunk. If you want to play it at high resolution then AI tricks are the only options for now. We are also at a point where graphics chips are getting ridiculously expensive to manufacture because of their size and number of cores.<br>Just a quick note. The 4000 series supports the new DLSS4 with the transformer model also. Just not the multi frame generation. you can do 2X but not 3X or 4X which is locked to the 5000 series.,0,2025-02-06T00:33:54Z

And since it does not know what&#39;s behind the object that needs to be blurred, plus some other issues like overlaying and opacity, it often results in weird artifacts at the edges of blurred objects.<br><br>So to make a fair test it should be made between True frames rendered without DLSS and with DLSS, with all other settings equal.

I believe what is happening is that the textures in the gpu memory are constantly being rotated in and out of vram, using up all the bandwidth between the CPU and the GPU, explaining the very poor performance. You should be getting around ~150% more performance out of the 2080ti compared to the 980. Not 20 times.

So basically their gpu&#39;s in the near 6 years won&#39;t be doing much hard work but their Ai technology will which users like us wont be able to notice. Through this move they would cut down production cost for all of their gpus and can stay consistent with the gpu pricing like $2000 for the next 10 generation but still make 5x more profit which they are making right now without Ai. <br><br><br>So in simple words slowly all the hardware we use will merely become a empty containers which takes all the energy through Ai and dont have anything inside them.",0,2025-01-26T14:42:09Z

2256,3a8dScJg6O0,"I just want to put this in to try and explain DLSS and frame gen to people who don&#39;t fully understand. <br><br>           &quot;DLSS uses AI algorithms to upscale lower-resolution images, significantly enhancing visual fidelity while maintaining high performance. By rendering games at a lower resolution and then upscaling them, DLSS can significantly increase frame rates. This is especially beneficial for demanding games, allowing for smoother gameplay on high settings. DLSS can adapt its quality settings based on the performance of the hardware, ensuring an optimal balance between visual fidelity and frame rates. While DLSS generally provides high-quality images, it can sometimes introduce artifacts, such as blurriness or ghosting, especially in fast-moving scenes. DLSS operates in real-time, allowing it to provide upscaled images while the game is being played. This is crucial for maintaining a smooth gaming experience. DLSS does not introduce significant input latency. While any processing can potentially add a slight delay, NVIDIA has optimized DLSS to minimize this impact, ensuring that it remains responsive during gameplay.&quot;<br><br>            So this being said, every frame from the game is being rastered by the GPU in a lower resolution and then in real time it is being upscaled by the GPU to you&#39;re monitors resolution, depending on the DLSS quality setting you pick, the native resolution is a different percentage of the native resolution. This means that DLSS is not the problem with so called &quot;fake frames&quot; DLSS is actually a really good system that NVIDIA has created. <br><br>             Frame gen is the Fake frames that get hated on but, that being said Frame Gen has its place in gaming. If you want to play a single player or even multiplayer game that does not rely on fast precise inputs or you&#39;re the type of person who is not sensitive to latency it can be a great thing. I personally use DLSS on most games as I have a 4080 and a 5120x1440p super ultrawide monitor, that is a lot of native pixels to push on very high settings. <br><br>              I have only used frame gen on Flight Simulator as the title is very demanding and doesn&#39;t require me to worry about input latency, and in that use case it is very nice in my eyes. Now when I get on a competitive multiplayer game like CS2 or Valorant I find it unnecessary to run either DLSS or Frame Gen as the games are very well optimized as they are made to be competitive. If you wish to worry about NVIDIA focusing on DLSS and Frame gen when you are using a 4080 on CS2 native and getting 500+ FPS already then I don&#39;t get it. Would you like to get a 50% boost in performance on native so you can run CS2 at 700 FPS and get .002 microseconds faster pixel response time? <br><br>              My point being is GPU&#39;s have hit such high performance that in most cases when you need to run native its more than capable but if you are just chilling playing more casual games and want all the pretty settings and a nice frame rate then why not use the new tech? <br><br>              I want to hear what everyone thinks.",0,2025-01-09T23:21:50Z

There was very little difference in performance and I&#39;m not sure why that would be the case since the 4090 had way more cuda cores than a 4080 or 4080 Super.

It doesn&#39;t provide a clear comparison to the performance of the RTX 4090. With PCL values of 35 and 37, the estimated framerate is around 30 FPS at 1080p with DLSS Performance mode. While you might see &quot;263&quot; or &quot;125&quot; FPS, the latency is comparable to running at 30 FPS. Ideally, 263 FPS should result in approximately 3.8 milliseconds of latency, and 125 FPS should yield around 8 milliseconds. However, the actual latency is 5-10 times higher than if the game were running natively at those framerates. This makes playing any FPS game with such latency quite challenging, especially with a mouse and keyboard.<br><br>Don&#39;t be fooled‚ÄîNVIDIA is using DLSS 4 to mask the actual performance of the cards. Frame generation is cool tech and has decent use if the base framerate is at least 60 and is used on slower-paced games, likely with a controller. However, NVIDIA is advertising an actual performance jump of at most 30-45% as a doubling, without taking into account the input latency cost of frame generation. You can see on NVIDIA&#39;s 5090 page that, assuming the settings are comparable, the 5090 was getting around 27 FPS without DLSS or frame generation enabled at native 4K, with the 4090 getting around 22 FPS.",0,2025-01-13T02:31:32Z

With games wanting to use Raytraced lighting and other gimmicks for dynamic graphic fidelity and games moving away from static highly optimized scenes, there is no getting around anymore needing frame generation to get decent FPS.  It&#39;s the future and there&#39;s no going back.   Unfortunately, the side effect means that game developers will spend less time on optimizations.  The real issue then becomes do the upscaled resolution generated frames look good enough compared to straight rasterized frames scenes as a trade-off, including any issues related to movement, even when operating in 4k?

2794,3a8dScJg6O0,I think most people that understand PCs will understand what I&#39;m talking about The 5090 really is not needed quite frankly even a 4090 is not even needed I have a 4070 super TI and I can max out my settings to everything extreme ultra and still run 200 frames with amazing picture quality at 4K resolution I obviously have a 240 frames OLED monitor with 0.03 milliseconds response time I&#39;m hardwired with ethernet running 1 GB internet speed and I play perfectly fine I have a 16 GB card after all those settings I&#39;m only using eight gigabytes and I have 8 GB free of VRAM so obviously that card is more than enough to game ultra settings at 4K resolution without no issues whatsoever there&#39;s no need to pay extra money for those cards unless you are an 8K gamer meaning if you want to game at 8K then obviously the 4090 makes sense The 5090 is even better but that&#39;s only if you are playing 8K obviously 8K is not the standard monitor on the market currently which means no one even games at that resolution anyway so all these marketing tactics trying to sell you a graphics card that you really do not even need is absurd once 8K becomes standard meaning in video games and monitors then absolutely The 5090 or the 4090 whichever people can afford makes sense but until that happens there&#39;s no need for those GPUs food for thought,0,2025-01-14T20:15:17Z

3031,3a8dScJg6O0,"5080 is biggest joke of them all. You are getting half of the DIE deactivated, while still getting 16gb of vram, compared to 4080S there is only like 5% improvement and only sensible upgrade on HW itself is GDDR7 what at this time we don&#39;t know how great impact it will have. And of course you are getting drivers update behind a series. NVIDIA is forcing you to pay for 90 class so much, they are willing to make the 5080 absolutely useless. At that point you can get 5070ti with close to same cuda cores, same vram and overall the performance will be close to the same. And those AI Tops metrics are just absurd, I&#39;m not going to use fake frames to see the artefacts combined with blurry mess from upscaling TAA image thanks to current gaming industry trends and unreal engine unoptimization.

Often times, throwing a game on ULTRA/EPIC/CINEMATIC isn&#39;t even really an option because as action ramps up in games with particle effects, network latency, physics calculations, etc., you won&#39;t have a great time no matter what card you use. The extra 5% in &quot;bells and whistles&quot; you get from HIGH -&gt; EPIC is really hardware intensive. Playing on HIGH in most games produces an insane visual while keeps FPS super high.

3494,Fbg7ChsjmEA,"Hey, just some feedback regarding the graphs.<br><br>I think it would be nice to have a better indicator to more easily differentiate the specific card which is being reviewed, especially since this is arguably the most important part of these graphs, where the card being reviewed sits in relation to the other cards on the market. The green dot is nice, but it could still be more clear (having it be a different colour, more saturated, white border/background, etc), especially when there are multiple different cards highlighted in this way. (This goes along with the feedback which I&#39;m sure you have seen in the other comment/s, about having the whole row highlighted to more easily see which specific card you are drawing attention to, rather than having to pan across from the dot on the right to the name on the left).<br><br>Also, I feel like having the 1% lows for every card in the fps graphs creates more clutter than it adds value to the graphs (at least for me), as in almost every case the 1% lows are roughly the same percentage lower for every card. I found myself essentially ignoring them completely, and instead mainly just looking at the overall length of the bar, which ended up just being the average because it is longer. Personally, I the main thing I gained from the 1% lows bar is the difference between the average frame rates and 1% lows for each individual card, which is good for the card being reviewed, but isn&#39;t very useful for the 3090 when the review is focused on the 5080. If there is a particular case in which the 1% lows show a significantly different story to the averages, I think it would be better to instead mention this specifically, alongside a graph displaying primarily (or only) the 1% lows. Maybe an option would by to only show 1% lows for the card in the review, which would both help differentiate the card being reviewed from the rest of the cards, remove clutter, and, in my opinion, retain the most valuable bit of information that 1% lows show (how they compare to the fps average of the card being reviewed).<br><br>Last thing, it would be nice to have some way to more easily differentiate the different generations of card. The most frequent questions I find myself asking are &quot;how does this compare to the nvidia cards from the last generation&quot;, &quot;how does this compare the other nvidia cards of this generation&quot; and &quot;how does this compare to amd&quot;. All of these would be much easier to answer if the generations were grouped in some way, maybe by saturation (have newer generations be more saturated, and the oldest be grey). You could also group manufactures by colour (red/green/blue), although then you run the risk of it looking like unicorn soup. Maybe instead you could use red/orange/yellow. It would be less clear which manufacturer is which, but I think a viewer would be able to work it out pretty quick. Maybe putting the logo of the manufacturer next to the name of the card? (I&#39;m just realising now that you used to do this. Curious why you chose to remove it?). Not sure, just ideas.<br><br>wow this has become a wall of text",0,2025-01-30T07:34:02Z

Sometimes games can show a 15 FPS jump, some can show a 10 FPS jump, but then jumping from a 4070 Ti shows an average 36 FPS jump in some games. So that&#39;s more like what we will see from the 5070 Ti and 5080; it will be like a 36 FPS average less than the 5080.

In reality, there are two unstoppable barriers stopping rasterization improvements, which is the real reason for slowing down of performance of non AI features. This is why AMD is so far behind Nvidia, and actually, thanks to the AI boom, 50xx series of cards has better raster improvements than the gaming market could fund by themselves. The limits of bandwidth and memory cell size just limit what can be coherent on a chip, as while transistor sizes has gone down over last 10 years, bandwidth and memory cell size has stayed the same.

3919,Fbg7ChsjmEA,"I feel like this is because games aren&#39;t requiring faster data speeds..... they&#39;re requiring more data at once, per transfer. Software is outpacing elements of hardware in relation to the system as a whole. Look at the one spec that sets the 4090/5090/7900XTX apart from the rest.... Bus size. I feel like we&#39;ve reached the limit for a single frame of what can be rasterized on camera given the current state of AAA optimization standards with the addition of ray tracing data. <br><br>Were going to be forced to accept AI eventually or someone is going to have to figure out a way to greatly widen the &#39;freeways&#39; on our mother boards. It almost feels like Nvidia has contracts with developers to collude. <br><br>AMD needs to find a way to make their own mother boards with built in memory. If they can make a special CPU that can communicate with a far greater bus width in one of their GPU&#39;s.. I have a feeling it would solve the problem of low frame rates with Ray Tracing. Our bus sizes are just enough for 4k, add in Ray Tracing data and now for the complete frame, the data needs two trips for one frame. All DLSS is doing is freeing up bus space by lowering the resolution so the ray tracing data can fit across the bus at the same time as everything else and finish the frame in one trip. AMD doesn&#39;t need AI or DLSS, they can control both ends of the stick CPU - GPU. Nvidia can&#39;t. and I feel like Nvidia knows this, hence why they are locking down developers like Sony does to promote AI.. It allows Nvidia to increase frames, without destroying compatibility  raising bus speeds.. you would need proper CPU&#39;s, motherboards &amp; memory (and probably more stuff I don&#39;t know) to do so. I think this is also why their doing this crap with TAA. It&#39;s all a solution to work around forcing people to upgrade their entire PC&#39;s with special motherboards/memory/cpu.<br><br>If the bus width is the amount of data at once (single signal) the lanes from your GPU to CPU can transfer..... I look at it like pipes with water... eventually you won&#39;t be able to increase the flow rate with pressure alone,  you would need to widen the pipes. When a single frame now requires both image rasterization data (that&#39;s now unoptimized) AND ray tracing data, you run out of room. If data is water you&#39;ve now got a higher flow rate than your pipes can produce at a given width = bus width. <br><br>To produce a frame in a way the eye sees the world, would mean to fill a bathtub all at once and every split second it took to fill from there on out was your frame rate going down.<br><br>The modern GPU is like a really big really fast ride at Disney Land, that takes waiting six hours to get on because only 30 people fit in a train and the turnstiles require a single file line.",0,2025-02-01T00:40:10Z

Never change, Ali, seriously, never change, what you&#39;re doing is just superb. I&#39;d personally be completely fine with the increase in performance being equivalent to the increase in power draw with the 5090 over the 4090 had the price not been equally higher. If it wasn&#39;t for that and nVidia&#39;s straight up insane lies with their marketing gaslighting us into believing how fake frames are a real performance increase as if there were no drawbacks to them whatsoever, the 5090 would be so praiseworthy.",2,2025-01-26T12:05:52Z

4488,5YJNFREQHiw,"The jump from 30 to 40 in performance was because they went from I believe 8nm process to 4nm process. 4090 and 5090 share the same process, so realistically you won&#39;t see a similar jump until they go down to 3 or 2 or even 1. Using the same process the only real way they had to ink out performance was iterative improvements and sizing up the gpu die itself as well as increasing the power draw.",22,2025-01-23T22:34:53Z

Also Cyberpunk is one of the most intensive games, and seeing that low latency with all the bells and whistles is pretty impressive.  That said I hope we move away from fake frames in the future for the simple reason that more real frames means less artifacts, ghosting/guessing, especially when dealing with reveals and fast moving objects.

4523,5YJNFREQHiw,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YJNFREQHiw&amp;t=516"">8:36</a> i wouldnt say that. AMD obviosly proved themselves with the 7900XTX. sure, they did say they arent competing in the high end market anymore. but you never know. They could pull a fast one. They beat Intel after all. If they decide to make a high end card this time around that could sit between the 4090 and 5090 with less power draw and less price, (eg. RX 9090XTX) that, in my eyes, would be better than the 5090 based off of price and power draw alone as long as it sat between the 4090 and 5090 in terms of performance. And also, Obviosly they cant match it right now because THEY HAVENT RELEASED THE 9000 SERIES YET. WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT THE 9060 AND 9070 SERIES. One of AMD&#39;s strengths is creating efficient processors. so I think they&#39;d be more than capable to make a GPU around 50% better than the 7900XTX. Which would place it between the 4090 and 5090. and I guarantee you if they did it. it would be far more efficient.",5,2025-01-24T15:49:04Z

A 600W GPU can produce less heat than a 400W GPU if it is more efficient in converting electrical power into useful work (such as rendering frames) rather than waste heat.<br><br>How Is This Possible?<br><br>Higher Efficiency Components<br><br>Newer GPUs use advanced silicon fabrication processes (e.g., smaller nanometer nodes like 3nm or 5nm).<br><br>These processes improve power efficiency, meaning more energy is used for computation rather than heat dissipation.<br><br>Better Power Delivery &amp; VRMs<br><br>Higher-quality voltage regulation modules (VRMs) and power management techniques reduce wasted energy in conversion.<br><br>Advanced Cooling Solutions<br><br>Vapor chamber cooling, better heatsinks, and fans can dissipate heat more effectively.<br><br>This means even if total power consumption is higher, the GPU surface feels cooler due to better heat dissipation.<br><br>Dynamic Power Management<br><br>Modern GPUs optimize power usage dynamically, consuming only what is needed per workload, reducing unnecessary heat generation.<br><br>Example:<br><br>A 400W GPU with 75% efficiency wastes 100W as heat (400W √ó 25%).<br><br>A 600W GPU with 90% efficiency wastes 60W as heat (600W √ó 10%).<br><br>Even though the 600W GPU draws more power, it generates less heat overall because it converts more of that power into useful work rather than waste heat.",1,2025-01-31T23:33:39Z

Well, in single-player games that revolve around YOUR hardware and YOUR software, it is a massive spike in performance for most games when you talk about smoothness of the game. Now, for any MP game that relies on constant data from your computer and is reliant mostly on the server getting the data and sending you the data, it doesn&#39;t affect anything. If your software, on your PC generates additional 3 frames between the in-game frames, the server just DOESNT CARE. It will still utilize only the frames between the ones you generated. It doesn&#39;t care, it won&#39;t use and your visual smoothness is exactly that, - visual smoothness. They haven&#39;t actually increased performance, they added fake frames between the real frames, which doesn&#39;t equal performance in any way.

4706,5YJNFREQHiw,"When Nvidia is chalking out a new product range, there is a maximum die size that they can produce cost effectively at scale. Assuming Moore&#39;s law is mostly trucking along, it&#39;s around 600mm2 and 40% faster than last gen. For this example, lets say a new generation die is 600mm2 and has 10,000 cores and is given the nomenclature EX-102 (102 notates that highest end non data center silicon)<br><br>The tradition would then follow that their Titan and Quadro cards would get 95%-100% of the number of cores that this full 102 die has to offer (because they are using this die). So in this example they would have 10,000 cores.<br><br>The 80ti - Also on a 102 - 93% of the 10,000 cores, so around 9300 cores.<br><br>The 80 - 102/103 - 66-80% of the 102&#39;s full cores. But here&#39;s the thing. Sometimes these end up on 103. A smaller, cheaper, die. The other skus up until this point have fused off sections of the 102 die. The 103 is a different piece of silicon entirely. While it might seem unfair to compare them, they are still the same in architecture and scale linearly in some workloads. In any case, we would expect 66% of the cores or in this example 6600 cuda cores.<br><br>The 70 class cards are normally 50% and built on 104 so 5000 cores<br><br>The 60 class on 106 and hovers around the low 30s or 3000 cores<br><br>-----------------------------------------------<br><br>This is the expectation as it has been set for the better part of 15 years. It has only been until last gen [4000 series] that we received cards that were substantially different.<br><br>The last 90 sku was 87% of the full 102 die. Substantially less than a normal 80ti or titan but curiously, significantly more money. The 80ti, which used to give you the most silicon for the money (again around 90%) is now gone and replaced with the 4080 super, which was 55%. A noticeable drop in the amount of silicon. The standard 4080 even worse at 52%. The 4070 is a shocking 32%.<br><br>Using the data I&#39;ve listed above, it is clear to see that Nvidia has merely moved their entire stack down to make room for their 90 class cards. Again... these 90 cards have no substantial architecture differences that justifies the creation of a new sku. They aren&#39;t substantially more silicon. No HBM. No MCM. No stacked cache. They are just an 80ti class with 2-3gb vram modules soldered on. Is that worth $1500-$2000? Maybe... But what I cannot abide by is the squashing of the rest of their product stack to make it look like a better value than it really is.<br><br>Now we have the release of the 50 series.<br><br>5090 - 102 - 88% of 102 cores<br>5080 - 103 - 45%<br>5070 - 104 - 31 %<br><br>Are you seeing the downward pattern here? In two generations we have seen 80 class cards go from 80% of all the possible cores (3000 series) to 45% and increase from $699 to $999. Even adjusted for inflation, there is a massive markup on this.<br><br>I&#39;ve really gone on long enough and bless you to anyone who has taken the time to read this. <br><br>=================================<br>ùóßùóµùó≤ùòÄùó≤ ùóÆùóøùó≤ ùóªùóºùòÅ ùó¥ùóºùóºùó± ùóΩùóøùóºùó±ùòÇùó∞ùòÅùòÄ ùóÆùóªùó± ùòÅùóµùó≤ùòÜ ùòÄùóµùóºùòÇùóπùó± ùóªùóºùòÅ ùóØùó≤ ùóøùó≤ùòÑùóÆùóøùó±ùó≤ùó± ùòÑùó∂ùòÅùóµ ùòÜùóºùòÇùóø ùóµùóÆùóøùó± ùó≤ùóÆùóøùóªùó≤ùó± ùó∫ùóºùóªùó≤ùòÜ.<br>=================================",0,2025-01-24T09:06:12Z
