15,Q82tQJyJwgk,"Let me get this straight... So, Nvidia says we should want the 5090 because we get 25-30% more performance while consuming 36% more power, with a tiny chance at the the privilege to pay just 25% more than when compared to the 4090 launch? <br><br>It&#39;s been almost 2.5 years since the 4090 and in that time Nvidia essentially gives a bigger die with 33% more of the same 4090 GPU cores another 33% more slightly faster VRAM, basically 33% more 4090 for 25-30% more performance and more fake/inferred frames? <br><br>Nvidia didn&#39;t innovate or improve the GPU hardware one bit, every added capability or real generational improvement is the AI specific hardware, they took a bit more of their other Enterprise AI tech and bolted them on, switched to the latest Gen VRAM, jacked up the price and tells us we&#39;ll take what they give us and we&#39;ll like it. <br><br>Seriously, the comments about this being a 4090 Ti are really quite accurate. This is little more than a 4090 with some more cores and newer VRAM which Nvidia had little to do with outside of deciding to use it. <br><br>If this isn&#39;t proof that Nvidia is done with gaming GPUs then I don&#39;t know what else to tell you. Why waste time and resources on the consumer gaming GPU products when the same Blackwell silicon can be used in enterprise AI solutions and results in many times higher profit margins than when sold in products for gamers?",914,2025-01-24T00:58:52Z

138,Q82tQJyJwgk,"The 50 series is a huge letdown. They&#39;re good cards of course, but the way Nvidia talks about this stuff, you always expect a revolution, and you get an evolution. These are 40 series cards with a crapload of power pumped into them to keep stable. This is not exactly ideal. Nvidia is way too distracted with side projects. They&#39;ve got 5000 features they&#39;re working on, and only a small handful of them ever pan out. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Nvidia. If it weren&#39;t for them, we&#39;d be in a world of hurt. However, when it comes to just raw 3d rendering, we&#39;re getting screwed. I bought a GTX1080 for $500 in 2017, and today that will buy me a 4070. The 4070S is another $120. 8 years and only 85% improvement. That&#39;s insane. There was almost the same improvement from the 900 series to the 10 series, and that was 2 years. People always ask me &quot;dude how can you still run a GTX1080 and a 7700k?!?!&quot; and it&#39;s because I have a Gsync 144hz display, and in competitive games we all turn down graphics settings so I get lots of frames, and in games that aren&#39;t competitive, I have Gsync. So really nothing will change yet. Not until I can afford a card that will drive 1440p at 240hz+ for affordable prices. I&#39;m not paying a thousand dollars for a graphics card.

DLSS4 needs to render 4 frames to give you 1 frame polished visually &quot;lag free&quot;. DLSS4 increases of your computer input keyboard/mouse, your game character will react slower than in native resolution. You get only the visual illusion of playing on 200+ fps in 4k. Professionally explained by others on youtube. Personally I will wait next year for 6090 and I hope it won&#39;t be mainly software improvement as with 5090 case. 5090 is just overpriced card that didn&#39;t make a lot of improvement this year, this card might be better for AI than gaming. All the focus of the producer is shifted to AI and gaming is on the last spot. Doesn&#39;t worth it to spend your bucks this year. Usually I go one year model back when pricing is normalized, I wouldn&#39;t pay 2000$+ artificially bumped price.

216,Q82tQJyJwgk,"One way to explain the tensor cores and neural shading is as follows: The neural networks can be used to approximate extremely complicated functions for which we can&#39;t just write simple equations. However, we can create those networks with a simple procedure merely by showing them many examples. So for example we can show it what rocky terrain looks like at all levels of detail, and the network will learn how to do that, using less data (just what the network&#39;s values are) than trying to store all the terrain (what the network computes as output). It&#39;s sort of like procedural terrain, but learned instead of programmed. The tensor cores are what are used to efficiently compute those trained neural networks on the GPU. They&#39;re not the same as geometry or pixel shaders, so they need their own specialized cores for the task.",0,2025-01-25T16:24:30Z

227,Q82tQJyJwgk,"I think the simplest way to explain convolutional neural networks is: for every pixel, a new pixel value is calculated based on its nearby neighbours. E.g. if every pixel is replaced with the average of its neighbours, you get a blur effect. Think of a visual illusion where you see some broken lines and your mind fills in the missing parts of the line, that&#39;s how these CNNs would be used to preserve detail as they upscale. However, it&#39;s a lot of computation, and a challenge to preserve scene integrity because the neighbourhoods are small compared to the entire scene. Transformer models allow arbitrary areas to serve as context when computing new pixel values; think of it as like having configurable neighbourhoods to input to that computation. E.g. when trying to upscale the left side of a road in the game&#39;s scene, that computation can also refer to the right side of the road all the way across the screen.",0,2025-01-25T16:59:05Z

Nvidia completely forgot about the people that put them on the map.  To present this in the way that should make everyone excited, doesn&#39;t really represent the way Tech tips got my interest in this channel.  They will limit production, the prices will get inflated even more, and just doodoo on the on the gamers.  They have a different line of products for production, while good to have the flexibility, it only limits the stock further.  While a 30% markup can be sustained for income (as you mentioned). This is hardly for your viewer base.  Exciting tech, yes.  I guess you don&#39;t really remember what it was like to have a limited source of income.  Like when you get a GPU to review and keep (or even sell in some cases).  Go ahead and promote a product that will just scalp your viewers money (or other creators &quot;Honey&quot;)  I still wish it was like the start of LTM.

Without shaders most games would run really fast since rasterization is really well optimized.

336,Q82tQJyJwgk,"Man, I can only hope one day Nvidia will make GPUs again.  Sure, the tech is cool, but I&#39;d rather see focus on a solid foundation of actual graphical processing, with neural shit being an additive that can be used to increase frames in exchange for some artifacts.  But it&#39;s treated as mandatory.  I&#39;d rather see something like a SOLID 120fps in those first graphs.  As much as that&#39;s overkill, and I&#39;m happy getting 60fps, or, depending on the game, even  30fps, I usually want to shoot for 120fps steady.  Especially in a game like Call of Duty.  And for $2,000, it just doesn&#39;t feel worth the money.  The ONE thing that is attractive is that 32gb of vram.  Devs seem to be getting more and more lazy with two things: Storage and vram.  My 8gb of my 2080 super are becoming inadequate, so it feels like, if I&#39;m gonna spend $1,000 on a 4090, I might as well jump to $2,000 for the latest, just based on that vram.  But I buy GPUs at the top end so I don&#39;t have to buy them for a while.  And I do like to max out the settings.  Honestly, I don&#39;t see the artifact in gameplay, but knowing they&#39;re there, and they could&#39;ve put more effort into proper raw performance bothers me greatly.",1,2025-01-25T14:02:40Z

409,Q82tQJyJwgk,"sorry guys, (and other youtube commenters)  i watched the entire video and I still don&#39;t know if I should upgrade or wait on my 2060 build from 2019.... any chance you could do a guide for the average schmo like me?? I&#39;ve got as much as ¬£2500 to spend on a new PC if I push myself and save up (and keep the heating off this winter like i have been!) So, should I go for a 4070 custom from Cyberpower (or other custom pc provider) or wait until the next generation. I will also say that (almost) all of the games I am interested in playing work on my 1440p monitor to a satisfactory degree on the 2060 with a i5-9600k cpu play decently - although I have to sacrifice some graphical fidelity or FPS. Its been a few years, so I am ready to spend more money than i spent on my current system to updrade, but I&#39;m wondering how long I should wait. if it helps to diagnose my needs, the games I am struggling to play are Cyberpunk (60fps on med with DLSS), KCD (45fps~) and starfield (50fps~ on med). I&#39;m good with skipping Starfield as it is unplayable at any FPS (holy shit, Bethesda need to update their gameplay) but I quite liked KCD and Cyberpunk - although the low fps made me decide to come back to them with a better system. I also have a lot of newer games in mind to play, which I am certain the 2060 will struggle with, but am willing to play indie titles or older games for the next coupe of years if it means I can skip a few generations of poor value from Nvidia. I have never owned a Radion Card... but also, maybe unfairly, aren&#39;t interested in them either - I think (possibly incorrectly) that Nvidia is better value in the long term (as I can only afford to upgrade every 5-6 years)... so what do you reckon I should do guys??",2,2025-01-29T21:19:57Z

492,Q82tQJyJwgk,This was pretty much my conclusion too. The 5090 is just a 4090-Super-Duper and the only impressive thing about it is the fact they fit this MEGALODON GPU into a 2-slot card with no issues. The 5080 looks decent but 16GB is a bit low considering its supposed to be 20% faster than 4080-Super. The 5070-Ti is the card that makes sense to me this generation. Should be the same performance as 4080-Super for $250 less. Thats just a win in my book. And then the 5070 12GB just doesn&#39;t have enough VRAM again so if you are looking for a card around $500 Ill probably refer you to AMDs 9070/XT.,0,2025-01-26T16:38:14Z

Starting with 40 series Nividia skimped out and scammed everyone with a shit resolution hack. DLSS, truly its a hack, not even an AI hack but a lower resolution hack. Apples to Apples, or its no dice, unless you like 720 p. Analog is better than 720. For 50 series cards less than the 5090, the 30 series cards hang with the 50 series for true FPS. Im talking 3080 vs 5080. Especially in higher resolution, and screw that ray tracing.  For the money, it is not worth it at all.
