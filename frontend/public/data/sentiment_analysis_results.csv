2025-01-24 00:58:52+00:00,"Let me get this straight... So, Nvidia says we should want the 5090 because we get 25-30% more performance while consuming 36% more power, with a tiny chance at the the privilege to pay just 25% more than when compared to the 4090 launch?   It's been almost 2.5 years since the 4090 and in that time Nvidia essentially gives a bigger die with 33% more of the same 4090 GPU cores another 33% more slightly faster VRAM, basically 33% more 4090 for 25-30% more performance and more fake/inferred frames?   Nvidia didn't innovate or improve the GPU hardware one bit, every added capability or real generational improvement is the AI specific hardware, they took a bit more of their other Enterprise AI tech and bolted them on, switched to the latest Gen VRAM, jacked up the price and tells us we'll take what they give us and we'll like it.   Seriously, the comments about this being a 4090 Ti are really quite accurate. This is little more than a 4090 with some more cores and newer VRAM which Nvidia had little to do with outside of deciding to use it.   If this isn't proof that Nvidia is done with gaming GPUs then I don't know what else to tell you. Why waste time and resources on the consumer gaming GPU products when the same Blackwell silicon can be used in enterprise AI solutions and results in many times higher profit margins than when sold in products for gamers?",Neutral

2025-01-24 20:53:53+00:00,"6:50 Professional ""AI Dork"" here... The 5090 having 32GB VRAM is basically useless. It will not be able to run hardly anything that the 4090 can't already run blisteringly fast  For example, my 3090 can generate text with a maximum size model that can fit in 24GB VRAM at over 120 words per second across 4 streams, which is already monumentally faster than any normal person can read  Now, the 5090 can fit damn near no bigger models (cause 32GB VRAM is still pitifully small for LLMs, not even being able to fit a full precision 20B param model when we have models that are 600B-1T+ in size now), but at an even faster speed, which basically nobody wants. The limit of quality for local AI is not speed. It hasn't been for a very long time. The limit is quality and network size, something of which the 5090 will do basically nothing to improve.  So in essence, you can't really run anything too much better on the 5090, and now instead of generating at 3x the speed you can read, you can gen at 4x the speed you can read... groundbreaking  So yeah, the 32GB VRAM for the 5090 is the absolute bare minimum they could have given, and will still be a severe artificial limit on how useful the 5090 will ever be. A 3 gen old original A6000, which is like 1/5th the speed of the 5090 is far more useful, simply for the fact it has 48GB VRAM. People want better quality, not more speed when you are already way faster than you need to be",Negative

It should be shocking that a game from 5 years ago needs a +1500$ GPU to run above 60 FPS at 1440p, on Ultra yes, but the tech's been around for so long.  A 9800 GT, a mid-range GPU from 2008 costing 160$ can run Far Cry 1 at 1080p, max settings and above 120 FPS, a game that's 4 years older than it.

These are 40 series cards with a crapload of power pumped into them to keep stable. This is not exactly ideal. Nvidia is way too distracted with side projects. They've got 5000 features they're working on, and only a small handful of them ever pan out. Don't get me wrong, I love Nvidia. If it weren't for them, we'd be in a world of hurt. However, when it comes to just raw 3d rendering, we're getting screwed. I bought a GTX1080 for $500 in 2017, and today that will buy me a 4070. The 4070S is another $120. 8 years and only 85% improvement. That's insane. There was almost the same improvement from the 900 series to the 10 series, and that was 2 years. People always ask me ""dude how can you still run a GTX1080 and a 7700k?!?!"" and it's because I have a Gsync 144hz display, and in competitive games we all turn down graphics settings so I get lots of frames, and in games that aren't competitive, I have Gsync.

As much as that's overkill, and I'm happy getting 60fps, or, depending on the game, even  30fps, I usually want to shoot for 120fps steady.  Especially in a game like Call of Duty.  And for $2,000, it just doesn't feel worth the money.  The ONE thing that is attractive is that 32gb of vram.  Devs seem to be getting more and more lazy with two things: Storage and vram.  My 8gb of my 2080 super are becoming inadequate, so it feels like, if I'm gonna spend $1,000 on a 4090, I might as well jump to $2,000 for the latest, just based on that vram.  But I buy GPUs at the top end so I don't have to buy them for a while.  And I do like to max out the settings.

However, we can create those networks with a simple procedure merely by showing them many examples. So for example we can show it what rocky terrain looks like at all levels of detail, and the network will learn how to do that, using less data (just what the network's values are) than trying to store all the terrain (what the network computes as output). It's sort of like procedural terrain, but learned instead of programmed. The tensor cores are what are used to efficiently compute those trained neural networks on the GPU.

E.g. if every pixel is replaced with the average of its neighbours, you get a blur effect. Think of a visual illusion where you see some broken lines and your mind fills in the missing parts of the line, that's how these CNNs would be used to preserve detail as they upscale. However, it's a lot of computation, and a challenge to preserve scene integrity because the neighbourhoods are small compared to the entire scene. Transformer models allow arbitrary areas to serve as context when computing new pixel values; think of it as like having configurable neighbourhoods to input to that computation. E.g. when trying to upscale the left side of a road in the game's scene, that computation can also refer to the right side of the road all the way across the screen.",Neutral

Now imagine 4K. We just started getting into that resolution. My 144Hz monitor supports 165Hz OC via DSC, but I have it at comfortable 100Hz which I love.   Plus, capped frame rates and the GPU not only stays in cool levels, but the capping also helps in smoother gameplay since the GPU can be better in synchronization with the CPU. You can look it up, here, on YT. Capping the frame rates is good, end of story. Power consumption way less and the sync with the GPU culminates in smooth response times.

Nobody wants that AI generated frames they call DLSS that decreases resolution. Give us true specs and not that AI hack that gives us blurred resolution. 30 series the memory bus was good. Starting with 40 series Nividia skimped out and scammed everyone with a shit resolution hack. DLSS, truly its a hack, not even an AI hack but a lower resolution hack. Apples to Apples, or its no dice, unless you like 720 p. Analog is better than 720. For 50 series cards less than the 5090, the 30 series cards hang with the 50 series for true FPS. Im talking 3080 vs 5080. Especially in higher resolution, and screw that ray tracing.  For the money, it is not worth it at all.

The 5080 looks decent but 16GB is a bit low considering its supposed to be 20% faster than 4080-Super. The 5070-Ti is the card that makes sense to me this generation. Should be the same performance as 4080-Super for $250 less. Thats just a win in my book.

DLSS4 increases of your computer input keyboard/mouse, your game character will react slower than in native resolution. You get only the visual illusion of playing on 200+ fps in 4k.

Personally I will wait next year for 6090 and I hope it won't be mainly software improvement as with 5090 case. 5090 is just overpriced card that didn't make a lot of improvement this year, this card might be better for AI than gaming.

I've got as much as ¬£2500 to spend on a new PC if I push myself and save up (and keep the heating off this winter like i have been!) So, should I go for a 4070 custom from Cyberpower (or other custom pc provider) or wait until the next generation. I will also say that (almost) all of the games I am interested in playing work on my 1440p monitor to a satisfactory degree on the 2060 with a i5-9600k cpu play decently - although I have to sacrifice some graphical fidelity or FPS. Its been a few years, so I am ready to spend more money than i spent on my current system to updrade, but I'm wondering how long I should wait. if it helps to diagnose my needs, the games I am struggling to play are Cyberpunk (60fps on med with DLSS), KCD (45fps~) and starfield (50fps~ on med). I'm good with skipping Starfield as it is unplayable at any FPS (holy shit, Bethesda need to update their gameplay) but I quite liked KCD and Cyberpunk - although the low fps made me decide to come back to them with a better system.

2025-02-12 12:00:58+00:00,PSA  (linus please pin this)   DO NOT buy the 5090.  it is a fire hazard.  all the 12v power lines powering the card are joined together and put through a single shunt resistor.   it has NO way of load balancing the 600watts it uses.  AND is not able to even detect if any of the wires are broken.   600 watts through a single wire will cause a fire.  there are a couple vids with a low amount of views out there that explain and demonstrate this.  one shows that even on a non broken cable.  it's possible for one wire to be handeling 22 amps while the others are only doing 3-6 amps.   you can garantee that nvidia is going to have to do a recall on these cards.,Negative
